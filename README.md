# Python Project Template

This project provides a template for Python projects, aiming to help developers structure their projects in a professional manner. It includes a sample arrangement of files and folders, as well as examples of code and comment styles.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of the project.
- `tests/`: This directory contains unit tests for the project.
- `docs/`: This directory contains the documentation for the project.

## Code and Comment Style

The code in this project follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Comments are written in a clear and concise manner, explaining the purpose of the code and any non-obvious details.

## Getting Started

To use this template, simply clone the repository and replace the sample code with your own.

If you only need to write a single Python file, refer to `src/main.py` as your starting point. This file is set up with a basic structure and includes examples of code and comment styles.

Remember to replace the sample code with your own and adjust the structure as needed.
